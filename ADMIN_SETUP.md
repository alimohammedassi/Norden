# 🔐 NORDEN Admin Panel Setup Guide

## 📋 What's Been Built

### 1. **Admin Detection System**
   - Admin users are identified by email in `lib/config/admin_config.dart`
   - Login page automatically detects admin and redirects to dashboard

### 2. **Admin Dashboard** 
   - Full admin panel at `lib/screens/admin/admin_dashboard.dart`
   - 4 sections: Overview, Products, Orders, Analytics
   - Beautiful vintage luxury theme matching your app

### 3. **Database Ready**
   - Currently using Firebase Firestore (already set up)
   - Easy to migrate to MySQL + C# .NET later

## 🚀 How to Use

### Create Admin Account:

1. **In Firebase Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/norden-e6024/authentication
   - Click "Add user"
   - Email: `admin@norden.com`
   - Password: Create a strong password (save it!)

2. **Login as Admin:**
   - Run your app
   - Go to Login page
   - Email: `admin@norden.com`
   - Password: [your password]
   - You'll be redirected to Admin Dashboard!

## 📁 Files Created:

└── screens/
    └── admin/
        ├── admin_dashboard.dart    # Main admin panel

        ├── orders_management.dart   # Order management (coming next)
        └── analytics_page.dart      # Analytics & reports (coming next)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### Phase 1: Firebase Database (NOW)
I will build:
1. ✅ Product management (Add/Edit/Delete products)
2. ✅ Firebase Firestore integration
3. ✅ Update user app to read from database
4. ✅ Order tracking
5. ✅ Monthly analytics

### Phase 2: MySQL Migration (LATER - When you're ready)
When you build your C# .NET backend:
1. Create MySQL database
2. Build REST API in C# .NET
3. Replace Firebase calls with API calls
4. All UI stays the same!
